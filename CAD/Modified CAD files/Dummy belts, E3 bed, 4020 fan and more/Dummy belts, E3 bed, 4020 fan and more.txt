I added dummy belts for a visual overview of the belt path. I also changed a wrongly placed idler. The corner idler on the right was on the top but meant to be on the bottom. 
I also added a BLTouch mount, changed the Bowden part to use an M10 coupler instead of the collet and changed it to use an Ender 3 bed(because I had one already with spring steel PEI, I don't suggest it) 
I also changed the hotend fan shroud to take a 4020 fan because I had a Sunon fan. 
All the threaded insert holes are changed to 4.1mm because those fit the M3x6 inserts I got off eBay and the stock holes did not.
I also changed the hotend section to be the Dragon hotend. 

The relevant part is the dummy belt.
